   - Added dolphin file manager
   - Added nautilus as alternative file manager

3. AUTO-LOGIN SETUP:
   - Added greetd service configuration
   - System will now automatically log you into Hyprland on boot
   - No more typing 'hyprland' manually!

4. BUILD STATUS:
   âœ… Home Manager rebuild: SUCCESS
   âœ… NixOS rebuild: SUCCESS

ðŸš€ READY FOR REBOOT!

After reboot, you should automatically be in Hyprland with working keybindings:
- Super+Enter or Super+Q: Open terminal
- Super+R: Open rofi application launcher  
- Super+1-9: Switch workspaces
- Super+F: Fullscreen
- And many more!

Happy Hyprland computing! ðŸŽ®âœ¨
