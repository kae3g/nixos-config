Hi!  The font in my Cursor editor is really small, can we make it larger?

Next, last session I had to force-reboot because I tried opening up my Brave browser with SUper + R, and before my browser window was working, but suddenly it was hanging with `Apploication is not responding` and none of my Hyprland keybindings worked and I couldn't close that window or any windows or click or type in any window.  Is this a commo problem and is this fixable? I imagine it could be because I have some lattency in my internet connection right now, but should my entire computer crash because of that?  I didn't experience anything like that with GNOME.  Do you know if this happens with the Sway window manager instead of Hyprland?  If there's any way we can fix this with Hyprland, I would love to keep trying to use this window manager and keep on working with you to expand my configuration and get more familiar with it.

Next, with my current Hyprland setup, auto-start into Hyprland works with a reboot!  But it logs right in to my user environment without asking any username and password, or asking a password for my main home user, `xx`. 

Lsatly, I am still trying to get my blue light filter working.  Earlier we were adjusting some settings with gammastep, but I was getting some errors at the top of the screen, and we were having trouble loading our new Home Manager configuration and buillding and switching to it.  We may need to work on getting that right again and doing another Home Manager switch, sync to our Github repo for our ~/nixos-config-backup repo, and then doing another nixos-rebuild switch.

Thanks!
